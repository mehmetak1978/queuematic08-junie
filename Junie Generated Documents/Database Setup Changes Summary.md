# Database Setup Changes Summary

## Issue Description
Modified the setup-db process to exclude sample data insertion for `counter_sessions` and `queue` tables after cleaning.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified schema.sql
**File:** `/backend/src/database/schema.sql`

**Removed the following sample data insertions:**

#### Counter Sessions Sample Data (Lines 119-123)
```sql
-- INSERT INTO counter_sessions (counter_id, user_id, start_time, end_time) VALUES
-- (1, 2, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, NULL),  -- clerk1 active at counter 1 (branch 1)
-- (4, 4, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, NULL);  -- clerk3 active at counter 1 (branch 2)
```

#### Queue Sample Data (Lines 125-131)
```sql
-- INSERT INTO queue (branch_id, number, status, created_at) VALUES
-- (1, 1, 'waiting', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '5 minutes'),
-- (1, 2, 'waiting', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '3 minutes'),
-- (1, 3, 'waiting', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 minute'),
-- (2, 1, 'waiting', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '4 minutes'),
-- (2, 2, 'waiting', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '2 minutes');
```

## What Remains Unchanged

The following sample data is still inserted during database setup:
- **Branches:** 2 sample branches (Ana Şube, Kadıköy Şubesi)
- **Users:** 5 sample users (1 admin, 4 clerks)
- **Counters:** 5 sample counters (3 for branch 1, 2 for branch 2)

## Impact

### Before Changes
- Database setup would create tables and populate them with sample data
- `counter_sessions` table had 2 active sessions
- `queue` table had 5 waiting customers

### After Changes
- Database setup creates all tables with proper schema
- `counter_sessions` table is empty (no active sessions)
- `queue` table is empty (no waiting customers)
- Other tables retain their sample data for testing purposes

## Verification

The database setup process was tested and confirmed to work correctly:
- All tables are created successfully
- Views and functions are created properly
- Sample data is only inserted for branches, users, and counters
- No sample data is inserted for counter_sessions and queue tables

## Files Modified
