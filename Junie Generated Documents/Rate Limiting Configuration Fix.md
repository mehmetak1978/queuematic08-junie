# Rate Limiting Configuration Fix

## 🚨 Issue Description

**Error:** `DatabaseService.js:234 GET http://localhost:3008/api/counters/my-session 429 (Too Many Requests)`

**Impact:** The frontend was unable to access API endpoints due to rate limiting, preventing:
- Counter persistence functionality from working
- Automatic counter selection from functioning
- Normal user workflow during development and testing

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **overly restrictive rate limiting configuration** that was not suitable for development and testing scenarios:

### Original Configuration Problems:
1. **Fixed 15-minute window**: Same for both development and production
2. **Accumulated requests**: Extensive testing and development work exhausted the rate limit
3. **No environment differentiation**: Development needed more lenient limits
4. **Long reset time**: 15-minute windows made testing impractical when limits were hit

### Contributing Factors:
- **Frontend auto-refresh**: ClerkApp refreshes every 3-5 seconds
- **Development workflow**: Frequent page refreshes and testing
- **Test suites**: Automated tests making many API calls
- **Multiple browser tabs**: Each tab making independent requests
- **Session initialization**: Multiple API calls during app startup

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment-Based Rate Limiting

**File:** `backend/src/config/appConfig.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
rateLimit: {
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes for all environments
  max: 1000, // Same limit for all environments
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
rateLimit: {
  windowMs: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 1 * 60 * 1000 : 15 * 60 * 1000, // 1 min dev, 15 min prod
  max: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 10000 : 1000, // Higher limit for development
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.',
  standardHeaders: true, // Return rate limit info in the `RateLimit-*` headers
  legacyHeaders: false, // Disable the `X-RateLimit-*` headers
  // Skip rate limiting for health checks and preflight requests
  skip: (req) => {
    return req.path === '/health' || req.method === 'OPTIONS';
  }
}
```

### 2. Key Improvements

#### A. Environment-Specific Windows
- **Development**: 1-minute window (60 seconds)
- **Production**: 15-minute window (900 seconds)

#### B. Environment-Specific Limits
- **Development**: 10,000 requests per window
- **Production**: 1,000 requests per window

#### C. Enhanced Headers
- **Standard Headers**: `RateLimit-*` headers for better debugging
- **Disabled Legacy**: Removed `X-RateLimit-*` headers for cleaner response

#### D. Smart Skipping
- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint exempt from rate limiting
- **CORS Preflight**: `OPTIONS` requests exempt from rate limiting

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Before Fix:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3008/api/auth/login
# Result: HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
# RateLimit-Remaining: 0
# RateLimit-Reset: 767 (12+ minutes)
```

### After Fix:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3008/api/auth/login
# Result: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# RateLimit-Policy: 10000;w=60
# RateLimit-Limit: 10000
# RateLimit-Remaining: 9972
# RateLimit-Reset: 32 (32 seconds)
```

### Comprehensive Test Results:
```
🎉 COUNTER PERSISTENCE TEST COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! 🎉
✅ User can start a counter session
✅ Session persists in database
✅ Session is restored after re-login
✅ User doesn't need to select counter again
✅ Session can be properly ended

🎉 AUTOMATIC COUNTER SELECTION TEST COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! 🎉
✅ User can create counter usage history
✅ Last-used counter API endpoint works correctly
✅ Last used counter persists after logout/login
✅ Last used counter is available for automatic selection
✅ Automatic counter selection works without manual intervention
✅ System properly tracks and restores user preferences
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Production Security Maintained:
- ✅ **15-minute window**: Long enough to prevent abuse
- ✅ **1,000 request limit**: Reasonable for normal usage
- ✅ **IP-based limiting**: Prevents individual IP abuse
- ✅ **Standard rate limiting**: Industry-standard approach

### Development Practicality:
- ✅ **1-minute window**: Quick reset for development workflow
- ✅ **10,000 request limit**: Accommodates extensive testing
- ✅ **Auto-refresh friendly**: Supports frontend refresh intervals
- ✅ **Test suite compatible**: Allows automated testing

### Enhanced Security Features:
- ✅ **Better monitoring**: Standard headers provide clear rate limit info
- ✅ **Selective exemptions**: Only health checks and CORS preflight exempt
- ✅ **Environment isolation**: Different configs for different environments

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts:
- ✅ **Faster development**: No more waiting for rate limit resets
- ✅ **Better debugging**: Clear rate limit headers
- ✅ **Improved testing**: Test suites can run without hitting limits
- ✅ **Enhanced UX**: Frontend works smoothly without 429 errors

### Resource Usage:
- ✅ **Minimal overhead**: Rate limiting is lightweight
- ✅ **Memory efficient**: In-memory storage with automatic cleanup
- ✅ **Network optimized**: Fewer failed requests, less retry traffic

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### User Experience:
- ✅ **No More 429 Errors**: Frontend can access all API endpoints
- ✅ **Seamless Workflow**: Counter persistence and auto-selection work
- ✅ **Faster Development**: No interruptions from rate limiting
- ✅ **Better Testing**: Automated tests run without issues

max: 10000,                 // 10,000 requests
skip: health + OPTIONS      // Smart exemptions
```

### Production Environment:
```javascript
windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,   // 15 minutes
max: 1000,                  // 1,000 requests
skip: health + OPTIONS      // Smart exemptions
```

### Rate Limit Headers:
- `RateLimit-Policy`: Policy configuration (limit;window)
- `RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
- `RateLimit-Reset`: Seconds until window resets
