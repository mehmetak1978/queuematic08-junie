# Setup.js Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The `setup.js` database setup script was not working properly due to multiple issues that prevented it from executing and setting up the database schema correctly.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Environment Variable Loading ✅
**Problem**: The setup script didn't load environment variables from the `.env` file, causing database connection failures.

**Solution**: Added dotenv import and configuration:
```javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

// Load environment variables
dotenv.config();
```

### 2. Incorrect Script Execution Detection ✅
**Problem**: The script execution detection logic was using an incorrect comparison that prevented the main setup function from being called when the script was run directly.

**Original Code**:
```javascript
if (import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}`) {
  // setup code here
}
```

**Fixed Code**:
```javascript
import { fileURLToPath, pathToFileURL } from 'url';

if (import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href) {
  // setup code here
}
```

### 3. SQL Parsing Issues with PostgreSQL Functions ✅
**Problem**: The script was splitting SQL commands by semicolons, which broke PostgreSQL functions and procedures containing semicolons within their body (dollar-quoted strings).

**Original Approach**: Split by semicolons and execute each command individually
**Fixed Approach**: Execute the entire SQL content as one query, allowing PostgreSQL to handle the parsing properly

```javascript
// Simplified execution - let PostgreSQL handle the parsing
await client.query(sqlContent);
```

## Verification Results
After implementing all fixes, the setup script now works correctly:

- ✅ Database connection successful
- ✅ All tables created: branches, counter_sessions, counters, queue, users
- ✅ Sample data inserted: 2 branches, 5 users, 5 counters
- ✅ Views created: active_queue_status, daily_queue_stats
- ✅ Indexes and triggers created successfully
- ✅ PostgreSQL functions created successfully

## Usage
The setup script can now be run successfully using:
```bash
npm run setup-db
```
or
```bash
node src/database/setup.js
```

## Default Credentials
The script creates the following default users:
- Admin: username="admin", password="password123"
- Clerk1: username="clerk1", password="password123"
- Clerk2: username="clerk2", password="password123"
- Clerk3: username="clerk3", password="password123"
- Clerk4: username="clerk4", password="password123"

⚠️ **Important**: Change default passwords in production!

## Technical Details
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17.5
- **Environment**: Node.js v22.17.0
- **Module Type**: ES Modules
- **Dependencies**: dotenv, pg
