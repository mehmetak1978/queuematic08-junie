# Database Column Error Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to fetch queue status data. The error occurred at:
- **Endpoint**: `GET http://localhost:3008/api/queue/status/1`
- **Error**: `column c.name does not exist`
- **Location**: `/backend/src/routes/queue.js:293:28`

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the SQL query that retrieves the last called queue information. The query was attempting to select a `name` column from the `counters` table:

```sql
SELECT q.id, q.branch_id, q.number, q.status, q.created_at, q.called_at,
       c.id as counter_id, c.number as counter_number, c.name as counter_name
FROM queue q
LEFT JOIN counters c ON q.counter_id = c.id
WHERE q.branch_id = $1 AND q.status IN ('called', 'serving')
ORDER BY q.called_at DESC
LIMIT 1
```

However, examining the database schema (`/backend/src/database/schema.sql`), the `counters` table only contains these columns:
- `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `branch_id` (INTEGER)
- `number` (INTEGER)
- `is_active` (BOOLEAN)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

**There is no `name` column in the counters table.**

## Solution
### Backend Changes
**File**: `/backend/src/routes/queue.js`

1. **Removed the non-existent column from SQL query** (lines 294-295):
   ```sql
   -- BEFORE
   SELECT q.id, q.branch_id, q.number, q.status, q.created_at, q.called_at,
          c.id as counter_id, c.number as counter_number, c.name as counter_name
   
   -- AFTER
   SELECT q.id, q.branch_id, q.number, q.status, q.created_at, q.called_at,
          c.id as counter_id, c.number as counter_number
   ```

2. **Removed counterName from response object** (lines 304-313):
   ```javascript
   // BEFORE
   const lastCalled = lastCalledResult.rows.length > 0 ? {
     // ... other properties
     counterName: lastCalledResult.rows[0].counter_name
   } : null;
   
   // AFTER
   const lastCalled = lastCalledResult.rows.length > 0 ? {
     // ... other properties (counterName removed)
   } : null;
   ```

### Frontend Compatibility
The frontend code in `/src/models/Queue.js` already handles this gracefully through the `getCounterDisplayName()` method:

```javascript
getCounterDisplayName() {
  if (this.counterName) {
    return this.counterName;  // Uses name if available
  }
  
  if (this.counterNumber) {
    return `GiÅŸe ${this.counterNumber}`;  // Falls back to number
  }
  
  return 'GiÅŸe belirtilmemiÅŸ';  // Default fallback
}
```

Since `counterName` is no longer provided, the method will use `counterNumber` and display it as "GiÅŸe {number}", which is perfectly acceptable.

## Testing
### Verification Test
Created `/Junie Generated Tests/database-column-fix-test.js` to verify the fix.

**Test Results**:
```
ðŸ§ª Testing Database Column Fix
==============================
ðŸ“¡ Testing queue status endpoint...
ðŸ“Š Status Code: 200
âœ… SUCCESS: Endpoint returned 200 OK
âœ… SUCCESS: Response indicates success
ðŸ“‹ Response data structure:
   - Branch ID: 1
   - Branch Name: Ana Åžube
   - Waiting Count: 0
   - Active Counters: 1
   - Last Called: null

ðŸŽ‰ DATABASE COLUMN FIX VERIFIED SUCCESSFULLY!
   The "column c.name does not exist" error has been resolved.
```

### Manual Testing
Direct API call verification:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3008/api/queue/status/1"
```

**Response**: HTTP 200 OK with proper JSON data structure.

## Impact Assessment
- âœ… **Fixed**: 500 Internal Server Error resolved
- âœ… **No Breaking Changes**: Frontend gracefully handles missing counterName
- âœ… **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved
- âœ… **User Experience**: Counter information still displayed as "GiÅŸe {number}"

## Files Modified
1. `/backend/src/routes/queue.js` - Fixed SQL query and response object
2. `/Junie Generated Tests/database-column-fix-test.js` - Created verification test
3. `/Junie Generated Documents/Database Column Error Fix.md` - This documentation

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - The database column error has been successfully fixed and verified.
